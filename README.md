# ResumeBestMatchDjangoApp


Developed a Django-based API to match resumes against job descriptions and a threshold value.
Integrated Google Cloud Document AI for OCR to extract text from resumes and performed text mining techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the text.
Leveraged Google Vertex AI (Gemini AI) for advanced resume matching based on the job description and threshold percentage.
Containerized the application with Docker and used Docker Compose for data volume management.
Deployed the app on Google Cloud Run and pushed Docker images to Google Artifact Registry for scalable and efficient hosting.
